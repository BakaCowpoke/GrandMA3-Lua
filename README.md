I recently took up learning the GrandMA3 software.  

In short order, I was stumbling into features that seem to be absent on the MA.  
It being my slow season, I decided to take up addressing some of where it seems to be lacking.

I hope Alfred (Shared Table of Functions), Impy (Also a Shared Table of Functions), and I can save you some time and headaches.

Feel free to use these, even as an example of what NOT to do.  
Just because it works doesn't mean it's pretty.

And I do apologize if my comments in the files seem verbose.

Hope it Helps!
