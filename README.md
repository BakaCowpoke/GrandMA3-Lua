# Welcome to my repository.

#### I recently took up learning the **_GrandMA3_** software.

#### In short order, I was stumbling into features that seem to be absent on the MA.  <br>It being my slow season, I decided to take up addressing some of where it seems to be lacking.

#### I hope **Alfred**, **Impy** <br>(_a couple Shared Tables of Functions you will find occasionally in my code_), <br>and I can  save you some time and headaches.

#### Feel free to use these, even as an example of what **_NOT_** to do.  <br> Just because it works doesn't mean it's pretty.

#### And I do apologize if my comments in the files get verbose.

### Hope it Helps!

#### With Lua, I started with [**Dark to Light**](https://github.com/DeeeLight/FromDarkToLightTutorials)'s tutorials on YouTube.

#### There is a good bit of Reference material in [**this repository:**](https://github.com/jefffarrow/grandMA3_lua_functions)

#### If you have a need for a structural map of MA3 you can find one [**here.**](https://github.com/4ubiks/grandMA3-filesystem)
