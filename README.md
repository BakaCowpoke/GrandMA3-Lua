I recently took up learning the GrandMA3 software.  

In short order, I was stumbling into features that seem to be absent on the MA.  
It being my slow season, I decided to take up addressing some of where it seems to be lacking.

Just Hoping to make life easier save some people some time and headaches.

I do apologize if my comments in the files seem verbose.

Hope it Helps!
